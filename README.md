# Algorithm Visualizer Pro
A comprehensive web-based application for visualizing various algorithms including sorting, pathfinding, graph traversal, and binary tree operations.

## Features
### Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort: Simple comparison-based algorithm 
2. Selection Sort: In-place comparison sorting 
3. Insertion Sort: Builds sorted array one item at a time 
4. Merge Sort: Divide and conquer algorithm 
5. Quick Sort: Efficient divide and conquer algorithm 
6. Heap Sort: Comparison-based sorting using binary heap 
7. Radix Sort: Non-comparative integer sorting 
8. Shell Sort: Generalized version of insertion sort

### Pathfinding Algorithms
1. *A Search**: Informed search algorithm using heuristics 
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds shortest paths in weighted graphs 
3. Breadth-First Search: Explores nodes level by level 
4. Depth-First Search: Explores as far as possible along branches 
5. Greedy Best-First: Uses heuristic function to guide search 
6. Bidirectional Search: Searches from both start and end simultaneously

### Graph Traversal
1. BFS Traversal: Breadth-first graph traversal

2. DFS Traversal: Depth-first graph traversal 
3. Topological Sort: Linear ordering of vertices in DAG

4. Dijkstra's Shortest Path: Finds shortest paths in weighted graphs

5. Minimum Spanning Tree: Finds MST using Kruskal's algorithm

### Binary Tree Operations
1. Insert Node: Adds nodes to binary search tree

2. Search Node: Finds nodes in the tree

3. Delete Node: Removes nodes from the tree

4. In-order Traversal: Left, Root, Right

5. Pre-order Traversal: Root, Left, Right

6. Post-order Traversal: Left, Right, Root

7. Level-order Traversal: Breadth-first traversal

## Technologies Used
1. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

2. Canvas API for visualizations

3. Web Audio API for sound effects

4. Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
